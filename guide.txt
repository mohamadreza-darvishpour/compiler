start compiler



To start writing a simple compiler in C++, you can follow these general
 steps:

1. Define the Language: Clearly define the syntax and semantics of 
the programming language you want to compile. Specify the rules for 
variables, statements, expressions, control flow, etc.

2. Lexical Analysis (Tokenization): Implement a lexer to break 
the source code into meaningful tokens. Identify keywords, identifiers
, operators, literals, and other language-specific elements.

3. Syntax Analysis (Parsing): Design and implement a parser to analyze
 the structure of the source code based on a formal grammar. You can 
 use tools like Lex and Yacc, or parser generators like ANTLR, or hand-code
  your parser.

4. Abstract Syntax Tree (AST): Construct an Abstract Syntax Tree 
from the parsed source code. The AST represents the hierarchical 
structure of the program and captures its semantics.

5. Semantic Analysis: Perform semantic analysis on the AST to enforce 
language-specific rules, such as type checking, scoping, and resolving
 references. This step helps ensure the correctness of the program.

6. Intermediate Representation: Transform the AST into an intermediate
 representation (IR) that is easier to work with during subsequent stages. 
 The IR can be a lower-level representation or a specialized form for 
 optimization.

7. Code Generation: Generate target code (e.g., machine code, bytecode, 
or an intermediate language) from the IR. This involves mapping the 
high-level language constructs to the target platform.

8. Optimization: Apply various optimization techniques to improve 
the efficiency and performance of the generated code. This can include 
optimizations like constant folding, dead code elimination, loop 
optimizations, etc.

9. Symbol Table Management: Implement a symbol table to keep track 
of identifiers, their types, and other relevant information during 
compilation.

10. Error Handling: Develop a mechanism to handle and report 
compilation errors, including syntax errors, semantic errors, and 
other issues encountered during the compilation process.

11. Testing and Debugging: Create a suite of test cases to verify 
the correctness of your compiler. Test it against different scenarios, 
edge cases, and sample programs. Debug and fix any issues that arise.

12. Documentation: Document your compiler's design, architecture, and
 any language-specific features or limitations. Provide clear
  instructions on how to use and compile programs with your compiler.

Remember that building a full-fledged compiler is a complex task, 
and these steps provide a high-level overview. Depending on the language 
and features you want to support, there may be additional steps or 
considerations. It's also helpful to study existing compiler frameworks, 
books, and resources to gain a deeper understanding of the concepts 
involved in compiler construction.
